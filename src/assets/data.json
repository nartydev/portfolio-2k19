During these three months, I was able to work on a ReactJS/NextJS stack as well as internal applications made in Nodejs. I was able to deepen my knowledge in front development and back-end end development thanks to this work.

The application is based on a wheel with themes that players must rotate to perform actions. Each player is assigned an avatar, which gives him a real identity. These are displayed in a ranking that counts the sips drunk. The game includes prevention: every 10 sips drunk, a message is displayed (can't drive, may do unfortunate things, can't get out...). The main purpose is to entertain the players and create interaction between them.",
