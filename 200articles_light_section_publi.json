A well-known example is the human immunodeficiency virus that uses CD4 cell surface molecules to enter host lymphocytes and thereby deleteriously destroying the helper cell population of the immune system. A more complicated mechanism is seen in multiple sclerosis (MS) where human herpes virus-6A (HHV-6A) infects astrocytes by docking to the CD46 surface receptor. Such HHV-6A infection in the brain of MS patients has recently been postulated to enable Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) to transform latently infected B-lymphocytes in brain lesions leading to the well-known phenomenon of oligoclonal immunoglobulin production that is widely used in the diagnosis of MS. The cellular immune response to HHV-6A and EBV is one part of the pathogenic mechanisms in MS. A more subtle pathogenic mechanism can be seen in the downregulation of CD46 on astrocytes by the infecting HHV-6A. Since CD46 is central in regulating the complement system, a lack of CD46 can lead to hyperactivation of the complement system. In fact, activation of the complement system in brain lesions is a well-known pathogenic mechanism in MS. In this review, it is postulated that a similar mechanism is central in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). One of the earliest changes in the retina of AMD patients is the loss of CD46 expression in the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in the course of geographic atrophy. Furthermore, CD46 deficient mice spontaneously develop dry-type AMD-like changes in their retina. It is also well known that certain genetic polymorphisms in the complement-inhibiting pathways correlate with higher risks of AMD development. The tenet is that HHV-6A infection of the retina leads to downregulation of CD46 and consequently to hyperactivation of the complement system in the eyes of susceptible individuals.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">human herpes virus-6A, age-related macular degeneration, CD46, complement system proteins, autophagy, parainflammation, inflammaging</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["22","83","111","128"],"text":["immune","brain","astrocytes","virus"],"type":["therapeutic area","organ","cell type","organism"],"category":["disease","disease","sample type","taxonomy"],"slide":["3.0","3.0","3.0","3.0"],"filter_query":["1.0","4.0","6.0","7.0"],"d_l":["l","d","l","d"],"s_m":["m","m","m","m"]},"PMCID":"5651521","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2017.01314","section":"publi"}

Manipulation of the gut microbiota through the administration of prebiotics or probiotics may assist in weight loss and reduce plasma glucose and serum lipid levels, decreasing the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus. To the best of our knowledge, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile salt hydrolase (BSH), metabolic endotoxemia and the endocannabinoid (eCB) system are essential in regulating the initiation and progression of MS through the normalization of adipogenesis and the regulation of insulin secretion, fat accumulation, energy homeostasis, and plasma cholesterol levels.

Despite a significant effort to assure safety of use, toxicological analysis of these substances, generally, rely on their direct toxicity to target organs (liver and kidney) or their genotoxic effects. Much less attention is paid to the effects of these compounds on cells of the immune system. This is of relevance given that metabolic dysregulation and obesity have a strong immune-mediated component. Obese individuals present a state of chronic low-grade inflammation that contributes to the establishment of insulin resistance and other metabolic abnormalities known as the metabolic syndrome. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are currently recognized as worldwide epidemics that pose a profound socioeconomic impact and represent a concern to public health. Cells of the immune system contribute to both the maintenance of “lean homeostasis” and the metabolic dysregulation observed in obese individuals. Although much attention has been drawn in the past decades to obesity and metabolic syndrome as a result of ingesting highly processed food containing large amounts of fat and simple sugars, mounting evidence suggest that food additives may also be important contributors to metabolic derangement. Herein, we review pieces of evidence from the literature showing that food additives have relevant effects on cells of the immune system that could contribute to immune-mediated metabolic dysregulation.

Further, veterinarians and dog owners typically dismiss inherited/genetic diseases as possibilities for health problems in mixed-breed dogs, assuming hybrid vigor will guarantee that single-gene disease mutations are not a cause for concern. Therefore, the objective of this study was to screen a large mixed-breed canine population for the presence of mutant alleles associated with five autosomal recessive disorders: hyperuricosuria and hyperuricemia (HUU), cystinuria (CYST), factor VII deficiency (FVIID), myotonia congenita (MYC) and phosphofructokinase deficiency (PKFD).

It has been shown that patients with anorexia develop neurotransmitter-related disorders, leading to uncontrolled changes in the immune and endocrine systems. Interactions between cytokines, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters play an important role in disease development. Significant malnutrition induces disorders and alterations in T-cell populations. The cellular response in patients with anorexia nervosa has been shown to be normal, although opinions on this issue are controversial. Laboratory studies on neutrophils in anorexia patients showed decreased adhesion and reduced bactericidal and cell activities. Despite such unfavourable results, patients with anorexia are resistant to infections, which are very rare in this group. Glutamine improves the performance of the human immune system. The administration of glutamine to anorexia patients, as a supplement to parenteral nutrition, has resulted in significant improvements in immune system parameters. The results of previous studies on the causes and risk factors in the development of anorexia nervosa are still ambiguous.

For instance, one study could look into the comparative clinical effectiveness of third-generation cephalosporins versus CIP, the latter not being presently the drug of choice for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children in Iran.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\"><strong>Keywords:</strong> : </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">acute diarrhea, enteropathogenic bacteria, diarrheagenic <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, ESBL, MDR</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["127"],"text":["bacteria"],"type":["organism"],"category":["taxonomy"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["7.0"],"d_l":["d"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5709696","DOI":"10.1089/mdr.2017.0204","section":"publi"}

All nine patients with confirmed mutations in <em>TIA1</em> were female. The clinical phenotype was heterogeneous with a range in the age at onset from late twenties to the eighth decade (mean = 60 years) and disease duration from one to 6 years (mean = 3 years). Initial presentation was either focal weakness or language impairment. All affected individuals received a final diagnosis of ALS with or without FTD. No psychosis or parkinsonism was described. Neuropathological examination on five patients found typical features of ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP, type B) with anatomically widespread TDP-43 proteinopathy. In contrast to <em>C9orf72</em>+ cases, caudate atrophy and hippocampal sclerosis were not prominent. Detailed evaluation of the pyramidal motor system found a similar degree of neurodegeneration and TDP-43 pathology as in sALS and <em>C9orf72</em>+ cases; however, cases with <em>TIA1</em> mutations had increased numbers of lower motor neurons containing round eosinophilic and Lewy body-like inclusions on HE stain and round compact cytoplasmic inclusions with TDP-43 immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence failed to demonstrate any labeling of inclusions with antibodies against TIA1. In summary, our <em>TIA1</em> mutation carriers developed ALS with or without FTD, with a wide range in age at onset, but without other neurological or psychiatric features. The neuropathology was characterized by widespread TDP-43 pathology, but a more restricted pattern of neurodegeneration than <em>C9orf72</em>+ cases.

To solve these problems, antibiotics have been used for many years in the prevention, control and treatment against disease as well as growth promoters to improve animal performance. Nowadays, the use of antibiotics in the European Union and other countries has been completely or partially banned as a result of the existence of antibiotic cross-resistance. Therefore, a number of alternatives, including enzymes, prebiotics, probiotics, phytonutrients and organic acids used alone or in combination have been proposed for the improvement of immunological state, growth performance and production in livestock animals.

Radiation-resistant glioma cells and normal astrocytes usuallly share similar mechanisms of radioresistance. Investigation of the underlying mechanisms of differential radiation response between normal astrocytes and glioma cells is thus significant for improvement of glioma treatment. Here, we report on the differential radiation responses between normal astrocytes and glioma cells at the transcriptome level. Human astrocytes (HA) and U251 glioma cell lines were used as in vitro models. The transcriptome profiles of radiation-treated and nontreated HA and U251 cells were generated by next-generation sequencing. In total, 296 mRNAs and 224 lncRNAs in HA and 201 mRNAs and 107 lncRNAs in U251 were found to be differentially expressed after radiation treatment. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that radiation causes similar alterations in HA and U251 cells, while several key pathways involved in cancer development and radiation resistance, including P53, TGF-β, VEGF, Hippo and serotonergic synapse pathways, were oppositely regulated by radiation treatment, suggesting their important role in this process. Furthermore, we showed the critical role of Hippo/YAP signaling in radiation resistance of glioma cells. In summary, our findings revealed novel insights about differential responses between normal astrocytes and glioma cells.

Moreover, the storage proteins accumulated in tobacco F18 and VT2eB dry seeds have structural properties that do not enable the early limited proteolysis observed in the wild type. Morphological observations by electron and light microscopy revealed a retarded mobilization of the storage material from protein and lipid bodies in transgenic seeds, thus impairing water imbibition and embryo elongation. In addition, both F18 and VT2eB dry seeds are more rounded than the wild type. Both the morphological and biochemical characteristics of transgenic seeds mimic the seed persistent profile, in which their roundness enables them to be buried in the soil, while the higher content of storage material enables the hypocotyl to elongate more and the cotyledons to emerge.</p></div>","key_words":{"index":["175"],"text":["lipid"],"type":["system delivery"],"category":["non-viral"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["10.0"],"d_l":["l"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5720674","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0187929","section":"publi"}

In the present work, the effects of portoamides on proliferation were examined in eight human cancer cell lines and two non-carcinogenic cell lines, and major differences in sensitivities were observed. To generate hypotheses with regard to molecular mechanisms of action, quantitative proteomics using 2D gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF were performed on the colon carcinoma cell line HT-29. The expression of proteins involved in energy metabolism (mitochondrial respiratory chain and pentose phosphate pathway) was found to be affected. The hypothesis of altered energy metabolism was tested in further experiments. Exposure to portoamides resulted in reduced cellular ATP content, likely due to decreased mitochondrial energy production. Mitochondrial hyperpolarization and reduced mitochondrial reductive capacity was observed in treated cells. Furthermore, alterations in the expression of peroxiredoxins (PRDX4, PRDX6) and components of proteasome subunits (PSB4, PSA6) were observed in portoamide-treated cells, but these alterations were not associated with detectable increases in oxidative stress. We conclude that the cytotoxic activity of portoamides is associated with disturbance of energy metabolism, and alterations in mitochondrial structure and function.</p></div>","key_words":{"index":["84"],"text":["lung"],"type":["organ"],"category":["disease"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["4.0"],"d_l":["d"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5720714","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0188817","section":"publi"}

We previously reported that a novel SARM compound, SARM-2f, exhibits anabolic effect on muscles, with less stimulatory effect on prostate weight compared with testosterone, in rat Hershberger assays and cancer cachexia models. In this study, we studied the mechanism of action for SARM-2f selectivity and also assessed whether the muscle increase by this compound might lead to improvement of muscle function and physical activity. First, we examined the tissue distribution of SARM-2f. Tissue concentration was 1.2-, 1.6-, and 1.9-fold as high as the plasma concentration in the levator ani muscle, brain, and prostate, respectively. This result showed that the tissue-selective pharmacological effect did not depend on SARM-2f concentration in the tissues. The ability of SARM-2f to influence androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcriptional activation was examined by reporter assays using human normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) and skeletal muscle cells (SKMC). SARM-2f exerted higher activity against AR in SKMC than in PrEC. Mammalian two hybrid assays showed different co-factor recruitment patterns between SARM-2f and dihydrotestosterone. Next, we studied the effect of SARM-2f on motivation and physical functions such as sexual behavior and motor activities in castrated rat or mouse models. SARM-2f restored the sexual behavior that was lost by castration in male rats. SARM-2f also increased voluntary running distance and locomotor activities. These results suggest that tissue-specific AR regulation by SARM-2f, but not tissue distribution, might account for its tissue specific androgenic effect, and that the muscle mass increase by SARM-2f leads to improvement of physical function.

The resulting variant dynamics were accurately described by Wright-Fisher models. The fitness ranks of the variants were almost identical between host genotypes. By contrast, the dynamics of <em>N</em><sub><em>e</em></sub> were highly variable, although a bottleneck was often identified during the systemic movement of the virus. We demonstrated that, for a fixed initial PVY population, virus effective population size is a heritable trait in plants. These findings pave the way for the breeding of plant varieties exposing viruses to stronger genetic drift, thereby slowing virus adaptation.</p></div>","key_words":{"index":["128"],"text":["virus"],"type":["organism"],"category":["taxonomy"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["7.0"],"d_l":["d"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5720836","DOI":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1006702","section":"publi"}

HCV generates oxidative stress correlating with disease severity. HCV proteins increase reactive oxygen species production by stimulating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) activity. Reactive oxygen species are necessary for host defense and cell signaling; however, elevated NOX activity contributes to cancer, and NOX overexpression is associated with hepatic fibrosis. Our aim was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NOX family members are associated with HCV‐related liver damage. Three hundred and thirty‐one individuals of European ancestry and 90 individuals of African ancestry, all diagnosed with HCV, were genotyped for 243 tagSNPs in NOX enzymes and their regulatory factors. Pathology scores were available for 288 Caucasians and 71 Africans, and mortality status was determined for all subjects. SNPs were tested for association with pathology scores and as predictors of mortality. In Africans, homozygosity for the A allele of rs12753665 (<em>neutrophil cytosolic factor 2</em>) and homozygosity for the T allele of rs760519 (<em>neutrophil cytosolic factor 4</em>) were associated with and predictive of higher rates of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis compared to other genotypes after controlling for age and sex. In Caucasians, homozygosity for the T allele of rs2292464 (<em>dual oxidase 1</em>) was associated with and predictive of decreased periportal inflammation after controlling for age and sex. No SNPs were significant predictors of mortality. <em>Conclusion</em>: In this exploratory study, three NOX‐related polymorphisms in two ethnic groups were significantly associated with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Future studies investigating these SNPs in larger cohorts of patients with HCV are warranted.

This nanosystem, named PDF nanoparticles, consisted of phospholipid/Pluronic F68 complex nanocores and pullulan shells. IR780 and paclitaxel were loaded separately into PDF nanoparticles to form PDFI and PDFP nanoparticles, which had regular sphere shapes and relatively small sizes. Upon near-infrared laser irradiation at 808 nm, PDFI nanoparticles showed strong PTT/PDT efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. In MHCC-97H cells, the combined treatment of PDFI nanoparticles/laser irradiation and PDFP nanoparticles exhibited significant synergistic effects on inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. In MHCC-97H tumor-bearing mice, PDFI nanoparticles exhibited excellent HCC-targeting and accumulating capability after intravenous injection. Furthermore, the combined treatment of PDFI nanoparticles/laser irradiation and PDFP nanoparticles also effectively inhibited the tumor growth and the tumor angiogenesis in MHCC-97H tumor-bearing mice.

The lack of concerted FMD control programmes in Africa has provided little incentive for vaccine producers to select vaccines that are tailored to circulating regional isolates creating further negative feedback to deter the introduction of vaccine-based control schemes. In this study a total of 80 serotype O FMD viruses (FMDV) isolated from 1993 to 2012 from East and North Africa were characterized by virus neutralisation tests using bovine antisera to three existing (O/KEN/77/78, O/Manisa and O/PanAsia-2) and three putative (O/EA/2002, O/EA/2009 and O/EA/2010) vaccine strains and by capsid sequencing. Genetically, these viruses were grouped as either of East African origin with subdivision into four topotypes (EA-1, 2, 3 and 4) or of Middle-East South Asian (ME-SA) topotype. The ME-SA topotype viruses were mainly detected in Egypt and Libya reflecting the trade links with the Middle East countries. There was good serological cross-reactivity between the vaccine strains and most of the field isolates analysed, indicating that vaccine selection should not be a major constraint for control of serotype O FMD by vaccination, and that both local and internationally available commercial vaccines could be used. The O/KEN/77/78 vaccine, commonly used in the region, exhibited comparatively lower percent in vitro match against the predominant topotypes (EA-2 and EA-3) circulating in the region whereas O/PanAsia-2 and O/Manisa vaccines revealed broader protection against East African serotype O viruses, even though they genetically belong to the ME-SA topotype.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">East Africa, FMD, Serotype O, Vaccine strain selection</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["128","147"],"text":["virus","in vitro"],"type":["organism","in vivo / in vitro / ex vivo"],"category":["taxonomy","gene modification technique"],"slide":["3.0","3.0"],"filter_query":["7.0","9.0"],"d_l":["d","d"],"s_m":["m","s"]},"PMCID":"5722052","DOI":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.10.040","section":"publi"}

The HK2 expression was significantly increased in glioma tissues comparing with the non neoplastic brain tissues and was positively correlated with the glioma grade. Silencing HK2 in glioma cell lines significantly decreased their proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenic abilities. Although, overexpression of miR-218 significantly downregulated the HK2 expression, luciferase reporter assay failed to show HK2 as the direct target of miR-218. A direct correlation, however, was observed between HK2 and Bmi-1, the direct target of miR-218.

Differences among these diseases in the quantitative characteristics of LAA clusters {i.e., extent, number, size, fractal property, and the relationship between these quantitatives} were assessed. The Chi-sqsuare test, unpaired t-test, and one-way analyses of variance with Tukey post-hoc tests were used to compare groups, spline model with an interaction terms were used to assess the relationship between extent and number, and exponential regression model was used to assess the relationship between extent and size.

Their unprecedented ability to present antigens to T cells has made them excellent targets for vaccine development. In the last years, a new technology based on antigen delivery directly to different DC subsets through the use of hybrid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to DC surface receptors fused to antigens of interest opened new perspectives for the induction of robust immune responses. Normally, the hybrid mAbs are administered with adjuvants that induce DC maturation. In this work, we targeted an antigen to the CD8α<sup>+</sup> or the CD8α<sup>−</sup> DC subsets in the presence of CpG oligodeoxinucleotides (ODN) or bacterial flagellin, using hybrid αDEC205 or αDCIR2 mAbs, respectively. We also accessed the role of toll-like receptors (TLRs) 5 and 9 signaling in the induction of specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Wild-type and TLR5 or TLR9 knockout mice were immunized with two doses of the hybrid αDEC205 or αDCIR2 mAbs, as well as with an isotype control, together with CpG ODN 1826 or flagellin. A chimeric antigen containing the <em>Plasmodium vivax</em> 19 kDa portion of the merozoite surface protein (MSP1<sub>19</sub>) linked to the Pan-allelic DR epitope was fused to each mAb. Specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, cytokine, and antibody production were analyzed. We found that CpG ODN 1826 or flagellin were able to induce CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and specific antibodies when the antigen was targeted to the CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC subset. On the other hand, antigen targeting to CD8α<sup>−</sup> DC subset promoted specific antibody responses and proliferation, but no detectable pro-inflammatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Also, specific antibody responses after antigen targeting to CD8α<sup>+</sup> or CD8α<sup>−</sup> DCs were reduced in the absence of TLR9 or TLR5 signaling, while CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation was mainly affected after antigen targeting to CD8α<sup>+</sup> DCs and in the absence of TLR9 signaling. These results extend our understanding of the modulation of specific immune responses induced by antigen targeting to DCs in the presence of different adjuvants.

Young New Zealand white rabbits underwent a pulmonary artery banding procedure and were euthanized 10 weeks later. Twitch contractions and calibrated bis-fura-2 calcium transients were measured in isolated thin right ventricular trabeculae at optimal length and with the muscle taut. Systolic calcium, calcium transient amplitude, and time from peak tension to 50% relaxation all increased with an increase in preload for both hypertrophied and sham groups. Time for intracellular calcium decline increased both with an increase in preload and an increase in extracellular calcium concentration in hypertrophied myocardium but not in sham, while time from peak tension to 50% relaxation did not significantly change between groups under either condition. Also, time for intracellular calcium decline generally decreased with an increase in extracellular calcium for both hypertrophied and sham groups, while time from peak tension to 50% relaxation generally did not significantly change in either group. Combined, these results indicate that the mild hypertrophy significantly changes calcium handling, but does not impact on the rate of force relaxation.

CB helps to eliminate heat and toxic components, and prevents the accumulation of phlegm and blood stasis in the liver. In Asian countries, CB Sativus (CBS), an ideal substitute for natural CB, is presently extensively used for long-term treatment of chronic liver diseases. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects and potential mechanism(s) of action of CBS on mice with fructose-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The NAFLD model was established in C57BL/6 mice by exclusively feeding fluids containing 30% fructose for 8 consecutive weeks. After these 8 weeks, mice were given CBS (50 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 consecutive weeks. Treatment with CBS reversed the fructose-induced impaired glucose tolerance. Compared with the model group, in which mice received 8 weeks of high-fructose diet and 2 weeks of 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, CBS treatment significantly decreased the levels of fasting serum glucose, fasting insulin, triglyceride, and total cholesterol, and increased levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. CBS treatment also significantly decreased the levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fatty acid in the liver. The activity of superoxide dismutase in the liver was increased after treatment with CBS, however, levels of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species decreased. Histopathological examination showed that liver steatosis and injury were significantly reduced in CBS-treated mice. The expression of fatty acid synthase, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, Cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-3, and synonyms B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 gene-associated X protein were downregulated after treatment with CBS, whereas the expression of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 was upregulated. In conclusion, CBS treatment exerted therapeutic effects in the liver of mice with NAFLD, which may be associated with amelioration of metabolic disorders, enhanced antioxidant effects, and alleviation of apoptosis.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">antioxidant, fructose, lipid metabolism, liver</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["104","175"],"text":["b-cell","lipid"],"type":["cell type","system delivery"],"category":["sample type","non-viral"],"slide":["3.0","3.0"],"filter_query":["6.0","10.0"],"d_l":["l","l"],"s_m":["m","m"]},"PMCID":"5723121","DOI":"10.2147/DDDT.S150187","section":"publi"}

We summarized what is known about OSA and its phenotypes, and review the literature on factors or intermediate markers that could increase stroke risk and CVD in patients with OSA. The OSA phenotypes where divided across three different domains (1) clinical symptoms (i.e., daytime sleepiness), (2) genetic/molecular markers, and (3) experimental data-driven approach (e.g., cluster analysis).

It poses a serious and growing worldwide public health problem that will only be partially addressed with the introduction of new antiviral therapies. However, these treatments will not prevent re-infection particularly in high risk populations. The introduction of a HCV vaccine has been predicted, using simulation models in a high risk population, to have a significant effect on reducing the incidence of HCV. A vaccine with 50 to 80% efficacy targeted to high-risk intravenous drug users could dramatically reduce HCV incidence in this population. Virus like particles (VLPs) are composed of viral structural proteins which self-assemble into non-infectious particles that lack genetic material and resemble native viruses. Thus, VLPs represent a safe and highly immunogenic vaccine delivery platform able to induce potent adaptive immune responses. Currently, many VLP-based vaccines have entered clinical trials, while licensed VLP vaccines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) have been in use for many years. The HCV core, E1 and E2 proteins can self-assemble into immunogenic VLPs while inclusion of HCV antigens into heterogenous (chimeric) VLPs is also a promising approach. These VLPs are produced using different expression systems such as bacterial, yeast, mammalian, plant, or insect cells. Here, this paper will review HCV VLP-based vaccines and their immunogenicity in animal models as well as the different expression systems used in their production.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">viral hepatitis, hepatitis C virus, preventative vaccination, virus-like particles, immune response, liver disease</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["22","128"],"text":["immune","virus"],"type":["therapeutic area","organism"],"category":["disease","taxonomy"],"slide":["3.0","3.0"],"filter_query":["1.0","7.0"],"d_l":["l","d"],"s_m":["m","m"]},"PMCID":"5723323","DOI":"10.3389/fmicb.2017.02413","section":"publi"}

To take up variant forms, bacteria may express an array of receptors.

The design of receptor arrays reflects key processes that shape cellular evolution. Competition may focus each species on a subset of the available nutrient diversity. Some gut bacteria can take up only a narrow range of carbohydrates, whereas species such as <em>B. thetaiotaomicron</em> can digest many different complex glycans. Comparison of different nutrients, habitats, and genomes provides opportunity to test hypotheses about the breadth of receptor arrays. Another important process concerns fluctuations in nutrient availability. Such fluctuations enhance the value of cellular sensors, which gain information about environmental availability and adjust receptor deployment. Bacteria often adjust receptor expression in response to fluctuations of particular carbohydrate food sources. Some species may adjust expression of uptake receptors for specific siderophores. How do cells use sensor information to control the response to fluctuations? This question about regulatory wiring relates to problems that arise in control theory and artificial intelligence. Control theory clarifies how to analyze environmental fluctuations in relation to the design of sensors and response systems. Recent advances in deep learning studies of artificial intelligence focus on the architecture of regulatory wiring and the ways in which complex control networks represent and classify environmental states.

Although PrP<sup>C</sup> has been extensively studied, particularly in the central nervous system, the biological role of PrP<sup>C</sup> remains incompletely understood. Here, we examined whether loss of PrP<sup>C</sup> affects the initial stage of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Acute pulmonary inflammation was induced by intravenous injection of LPS (<em>Escherichia coli</em> O26:B6) in 16 goats (8 <em>PRNP</em><sup>Ter/Ter</sup> and 8 <em>PRNP</em><sup>+/+</sup>). A control group of 10 goats (5 <em>PRNP</em><sup>Ter/Ter</sup> and 5 <em>PRNP</em><sup>+/+</sup>) received sterile saline. Systemic LPS challenge induced sepsis-like clinical signs including tachypnea and respiratory distress. Microscopic examination of lungs revealed multifocal areas with alveolar hemorrhages, edema, neutrophil infiltration, and higher numbers of alveolar macrophages, with no significant differences between <em>PRNP</em> genotypes. A total of 432 (<em>PRNP</em><sup>+/+</sup>) and 596 (<em>PRNP</em><sup>Ter/Ter</sup>) genes were differentially expressed compared with the saline control of the matching genotype. When assigned to gene ontology categories, biological processes involved in remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), were exclusively enriched in PrP<sup>C</sup>-deficient goats. These genes included a range of collagen-encoding genes, and proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (<em>MMP1, MMP2, MMP14, ADAM15</em>) and cathepsins. Several proinflammatory upstream regulators (TNF-α, interleukin-1β, IFN-γ) showed increased activation scores in goats devoid of PrP<sup>C</sup>. In conclusion, LPS challenge induced marked alterations in the lung tissue transcriptome that corresponded with histopathological and clinical findings in both genotypes. The increased activation of upstream inflammatory regulators and enrichment of ECM components could reflect increased inflammation in the absence of PrP<sup>C</sup>. Further studies are required to elucidate whether these alterations may affect the later reparative phase of ALI.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">acute lung injury, cellular prion protein, systemic inflammation, lipopolysaccharide, innate immunity, RNA sequencing, extracellular matrix remodeling, histopathology</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["25","84","180"],"text":["inflammatory","lung","injection"],"type":["therapeutic area","organ","system delivery"],"category":["disease","disease","non-viral"],"slide":["3.0","3.0","3.0"],"filter_query":["1.0","4.0","10.0"],"d_l":["l","d","l"],"s_m":["m","m","m"]},"PMCID":"5723645","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2017.01722","section":"publi"}

In addition to Th1/Th2 cells, whose role in IBD has been previously well defined, recent evidence indicates that Th17 cells and Tregs also play a crucial role in the development of IBD. Diets which contain excess sugars, salt, and fat may also be important actors in the pathogenesis of IBD, which may be the cause of high IBD incidence in western developed and industrialized countries. Up until now, the reason for the variance in prevalence of IBD between developed and developing countries has been unknown. This is partly due to the increasing popularity of western diets in developing countries, which makes the data harder to interpret.

Briefly, polyethyleneimine (PEI) was selected as skeleton material to synthesize PEI–polyethylene glycol (PEG)–TAT (PPT). Dox was conjugated to PEI using C6-succinimidyl 6-hydrazinonicotinate acetone hydrazone (C6-SANH), and a pH-sensitive Dox-PEI (DP) conjugate was obtained.

The intracellular uptake rate of PDT was enhanced (<em>P</em>&lt;0.05) when the contents of PPT in PPT+DP increased from 0 to 30%.

Thus, we developed an inhibitory intracellular single chain variable fragment (scFv) against CAPN5 as a potential way to rescue degeneration in ADNIV disease or in neuronal degeneration. We report that overexpression CAPN5 increases the levels of the auto-inflammatory factors toll like receptor 4 (TLR4), interleukin 1 alpha (IL1alpha), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and activated caspase 3 in 661W photoreceptor-like cells and SHSY5Y neuronal-like cells. Both C4 and C8 scFvs specifically recognize human/mouse CAPN5 in 661W cells and SHSY5Y cells, moreover, both the C4 and C8 scFvs protected cells from CAPN5-induced apoptosis by reducing the levels of activated caspase 3 and caspase 9. The cellular expression C4 scFv reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory factor IL1-alpha activated caspase 3 in cells after CAPN5 overexpression. We suggest that CAPN5 expression has important functional consequences in auto-inflammatory processes, and apoptosis in photoreceptor like cells and neural-like cells. Importantly, the specific intracellular targeting of antibody fragments blocking activation of CAPN5 act as inhibitors of CAPN5 functions in neural like cells, thus, our data provides a novel potential tool for therapy in CAPN5-mediated ADNIV or neurodegenerative diseases.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">CAPN5, retinal degeneration, photoreceptor, scFv, inhibitor</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["25"],"text":["inflammatory"],"type":["therapeutic area"],"category":["disease"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["1.0"],"d_l":["l"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5725022","DOI":"10.18632/oncotarget.22221","section":"publi"}

Obesity superimposed on aging drastically increases chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), which is an important link between obesity, insulin resistance, and age-associated diseases. Immune cells of both the innate and the adaptive immune systems infiltrate the adipose tissue (AT) and during obesity induce inflammatory responses associated with metabolic switches and changes in phenotypes and function of immune cell subsets. Obesity poses new health problems especially when it occurs in the context of other diseases, many of them frequently affect elderly subjects. An emerging problem is the decreased proportion of patients with obesity achieving clinical response to therapy. In this review, we will discuss the reciprocal influences of immune cell and AT inflammation in aging and age-associated diseases and the complex relationship of nutrient and energy-sensing homeostatic checkpoints, which contribute to shape the phenotype of the AT.

Whole genomic sequencing results indicate that the WSSV-CN04 genome was 281 054 bp in length, and encoded 157 hypothetic proteins. The genome sequence of WSSV-CN04 was most closely related to the low-virulent strain WSSV-CN03, sharing 97.5% sequence identity. Notably, in WSSV-CN04, the major envelop protein VP24 was not only truncated but also absent in the virions. Since VP24 was previously reported to be essential for WSSV <em>per os</em> infection by mediating WSSV-chitin interaction, we further analyzed the peroral infection of WSSV-CN03 and -CN04 in <em>Litopenaeus vannamei</em>, and show that the infectivity of WSSV-CN04 was significantly lower than that of WSSV-CN03. When compared with WSSV-CN03-infected shrimp, fewer virions were detected in the digestive tract tissues of WSSV-CN04-infected shrimp at 4 hours post-infection (hpi), and the viral titers in the animals at 24 hpi were much lower. Moreover, a peptide corresponding to VP24 chitin-binding domain reduced the amount of WSSV-CN03 in the midgut to a level similar to that of WSSV-CN04 at 4 hpi.

The DHA content in breast milk varies in direct correlation with maternal DHA intake and mothers consuming a Western diet typically have lower levels of DHA in their breast milk. Maternal DHA supplementation and direct supplementation of DHA to the infant has been tried successfully but there are still conflicting results on the optimal dosage and method of delivery of DHA to the infant. This has led to inconsistent results in trials evaluating the effects of DHA supplementation to the preterm infant in terms of cognitive and immunological outcomes.

This disease has tremendous impacts on millions of people and is a global health problem. The etiological agent of Chagas disease, <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatida: Trypanosomatidae), is deposited on the mammalian host in the insect’s feces during a blood meal, and enters the host’s blood stream through mucous membranes or a break in the skin. Identifying the blood meal sources of triatomine vectors is critical in understanding Chagas disease transmission dynamics, can lead to identification of other vertebrates important in the transmission cycle, and aids management decisions. The latter is particularly important as there is little in the way of effective therapeutics for Chagas disease. Several techniques, mostly DNA-based, are available for blood meal identification. However, further methods are needed, particularly when sample conditions lead to low-quality DNA or to assess the risk of human cross-contamination. We demonstrate a proteomics-based approach, using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify host-specific hemoglobin peptides for blood meal identification in mouse blood control samples and apply LC-MS/MS for the first time to <em>Triatoma dimidiata</em> insect vectors, tracing blood sources to species. In contrast to most proteins, hemoglobin, stabilized by iron, is incredibly stable even being preserved through geologic time. We compared blood stored with and without an anticoagulant and examined field-collected insect specimens stored in suboptimal conditions such as at room temperature for long periods of time. To our knowledge, this is the first study using LC-MS/MS on field-collected arthropod disease vectors to identify blood meal composition, and where blood meal identification was confirmed with more traditional DNA-based methods. We also demonstrate the potential of synthetic peptide standards to estimate relative amounts of hemoglobin acquired when insects feed on multiple blood sources. These LC-MS/MS methods can contribute to developing Ecohealth control strategies for Chagas disease transmission and can be applied to other arthropod disease vectors.</p></div>","key_words":{"index":["172"],"text":["peptide"],"type":["system delivery"],"category":["non-viral"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["10.0"],"d_l":["l"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5726658","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0189647","section":"publi"}

The physical mechanism that regulates glucan exposure is poorly understood, but it controls the nanobiology of fungal pathogen recognition.

We observed syntenic relations among all the isoforms of 14-3-3 for mammals, but not with that of birds or amphibians. However, the parasitic 14-3-3 isoforms, which have known antigenic properties, show unique sequence, structure and evolution compared to the human 14-3-3. Moreover we report, for the first time the existence of a bacterial 14-3-3 protein. Contrary to the parasitic isoforms, both bacterial and yeast 14-3-3 exhibited significant homology with mammalian 14-3-3 in protein sequence as well as structure. Furthermore, a human 14-3-3 inhibitor caused significant killing of <em>Candida albicans</em>, which could be due to the inhibition of the structurally similar yeast homologue of 14-3-3, BMH, which is essential for its life cycle. Overall, our bioinformatic analysis combined with the demonstration of a novel antifungal role of a peptide inhibitor of human 14-3-3 indicates that the sequences and structural similarities between the mammalian, bacterial and fungal proteins are likely determinants of the antigenic nature of these proteins.

The enhanced glutamate signaling via NMDA receptors appears to be one of the key events in the development of chronic pain. Although effective, clinical use of systemic NMDA antagonists is limited by adverse effects such as hallucinations and motor dysfunction. Opioids are also potent analgesics but their chronic use is accompanied by tolerance and risk of addiction. However, combination of NMDA antagonists and opioids seems to provide a stable pain relieve at subthreshold doses of both substances, eliminating development of side effects. Our previous research showed that combined delivery of NMDA antagonist Serine histrogranin (SHG) and endomorphin1 (EM1) leads to attenuation of acute and chronic pain. The aim of this study was to design and evaluate an analgesic potency of the gene construct encoding SHG and EM1. Constructs with 1SHG copy in combination with EM1, 1SHG/EM1, and 6SHG/EM1 were intraspinally injected to animals with peripheral nerve injury-induced pain (chronic constriction injury, CCI) or spinal cord injury induced pain (clip compression model, SCI) and tactile and cold allodynia were evaluated. AAV2/8 particles were used for gene delivery. The results demonstrated 6SHG/EM1 as the most efficient for alleviation of pain-related behavior. The effect was observed up to 8 weeks in SCI animals, suggesting the lack of tolerance of possible synergistic effect between SHG and EM1. Intrathecal injection of SHG antibody or naloxone attenuated the analgesic effect in treated animals. Biochemical and histochemical evaluation confirmed the presence of both peptides in the spinal tissue. The results of this study showed that the injection of AAV vectors encoding combined SHG/EM constructs can provide long term attenuation of pain without overt adverse side effects.

In the present study, we investigated a novel powdery mildew resistance locus, <em>PMR1</em>, using two mapping populations: 102 ‘VK515' F<sub>2:3</sub> families (derived from a cross between resistant parental line ‘VK515R' and susceptible parental line ‘VK515S') and 80 ‘PM Singang' F<sub>2</sub> plants (derived from the F<sub>1</sub> ‘PM Singang' commercial hybrid). Genetic analysis of the F<sub>2:3</sub> ‘VK515' and F<sub>2</sub> ‘PM Singang' populations revealed a single dominant locus for inheritance of the powdery mildew resistance trait. Genetic mapping showed that the <em>PMR1</em> locus is located on syntenic regions of pepper chromosome 4 in a 4-Mb region between markers CZ2_11628 and HRM4.1.6 in ‘VK515R'. Six molecular markers including one SCAR marker and five SNP markers were localized to a region 0 cM from the <em>PMR1</em> locus.

In the mutants’ brains, there are increases in C4b and C1q genes, which are considered to mediate synapse elimination during postnatal development. However, morphological properties of subcellular-scale structures such as dendritic spine in Shn2 knockout (KO) mice remain unknown. In this study, we conducted three-dimensional morphological analyses in subcellular-scale structures in dentate gyrus granule cells of Shn2 KO mice by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy. Shn2 KO mice showed immature dendritic spine morphology characterized by increases in spine length and decreases in spine diameter. There was a non-significant tendency toward decrease in spine density of Shn2 KO mice over wild-type mice, and spine volume was indistinguishable between genotypes. Shn2 KO mice exhibited a significant reduction in GluR1 expression and a nominally significant decrease in SV2 expression, while PSD95 expression had a non-significant tendency to decrease in Shn2 KO mice. There were significant decreases in dendrite diameter, nuclear volume, and the number of constricted mitochondria in the mutants. Additionally, neuronal density was elevated in Shn2 KO mice. These results suggest that Shn2 KO mice serve as a unique tool for investigating morphological abnormalities of subcellular-scale structures in schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and its related disorders.</p><div class=\"sec\" id=\"__sec1\"><h3 id=\"__sec1title\">Electronic supplementary material</h3><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"__p1\">The online version of this article (10.1186/s13041-017-0339-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></div></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">Mouse model, Schizophrenia, Intellectual disability, 3D electron microscopy</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["128"],"text":["virus"],"type":["organism"],"category":["taxonomy"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["7.0"],"d_l":["d"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5727961","DOI":"10.1186/s13041-017-0339-2","section":"publi"}

When accessible pre-existing microhomologies do not exist, we have postulated that new microhomologies can be created via limited DNA synthesis at secondary-structure forming sequences. This model, called synthesis-dependent microhomology-mediated end joining (SD-MMEJ), predicts that differences between DNA sequences near double-strand breaks should alter repair outcomes in predictable ways. To test this hypothesis, we injected plasmids with sequence variations flanking an I-<em>Sce</em>I endonuclease recognition site into I-<em>Sce</em>I expressing Drosophila embryos and used Illumina amplicon sequencing to compare repair junctions. As predicted by the model, we found that small changes in sequences near the I-<em>Sce</em>I site had major impacts on the spectrum of repair junctions. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that these repair differences arise from transiently forming loops and hairpins within 30 nucleotides of the break. We also obtained evidence for ‘trans SD-MMEJ,’ involving at least two consecutive rounds of microhomology annealing and synthesis across the break site. These results highlight the importance of sequence context for alt-EJ repair and have important implications for genome editing and genome evolution.</p></div>","key_words":{"index":["176"],"text":["chromosome"],"type":["system delivery"],"category":["non-viral"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["10.0"],"d_l":["l"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5728401","DOI":"10.1093/nar/gkx1056","section":"publi"}

In this study, we isolated islet cells of BALB/c mouse and purified CD4+ T cell subsets of a C57BL/6 mouse. The model for islet transplantation was established <em>in vitro</em> by co-culture of the islet cells and CD4+ T cells. IL-35 (20 ng/ml) was administered every other day. Following co-culture, the islet function and Treg/Th17 ratio were analyzed on days 1, 3, and 5. Furthermore, the Th17/Treg ratio was modulated (1:0–2), and the function of islet cells as well as proliferation of Th17 cells were analyzed. T cell sorting was performed using the magnetic bead sorting method; Treg and Th17 count using flow cytometry; cell proliferation detection using the carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) method, and islet function test using the sugar stimulation test. Results showed that Th17 counts increased in the co-culture system. However, after administration of IL-35, the number of Treg cells increased significantly compared to that in the control group (50.7% of total CD4+ T cells on day 5 in IL-35 group vs. 9.5% in control group) whereas the proliferation rate of Th17 cells was significantly inhibited (0.3% in IL-35 group vs. 7.2% in control group on day 5). Reducing the Th17/Treg ratio significantly improved the function of transplanted islets. Treg inhibited Th17 proliferation and IL-35 enhanced this inhibitory effect.

The key mechanism of p53-mediated arrest is transcriptional downregulation of many cell cycle genes. In recent years it has become evident that p53-dependent repression is controlled by the p53–p21–DREAM–E2F/CHR pathway (p53–DREAM pathway). DREAM is a transcriptional repressor that binds to E2F or CHR promoter sites. Gene regulation and deregulation by DREAM shares many mechanistic characteristics with the retinoblastoma pRB tumor suppressor that acts through E2F elements. However, because of its binding to E2F and CHR elements, DREAM regulates a larger set of target genes leading to regulatory functions distinct from pRB/E2F. The p53–DREAM pathway controls more than 250 mostly cell cycle-associated genes. The functional spectrum of these pathway targets spans from the G<sub>1</sub> phase to the end of mitosis. Consequently, through downregulating the expression of gene products which are essential for progression through the cell cycle, the p53–DREAM pathway participates in the control of all checkpoints from DNA synthesis to cytokinesis including G<sub>1</sub>/S, G<sub>2</sub>/M and spindle assembly checkpoints. Therefore, defects in the p53–DREAM pathway contribute to a general loss of checkpoint control. Furthermore, deregulation of DREAM target genes promotes chromosomal instability and aneuploidy of cancer cells. Also, DREAM regulation is abrogated by the human papilloma virus HPV E7 protein linking the p53–DREAM pathway to carcinogenesis by HPV. Another feature of the pathway is that it downregulates many genes involved in DNA repair and telomere maintenance as well as Fanconi anemia. Importantly, when DREAM function is lost, CDK inhibitor drugs employed in cancer treatment such as Palbociclib, Abemaciclib and Ribociclib can compensate for defects in early steps in the pathway upstream from cyclin/CDK complexes. In summary, the p53–p21–DREAM–E2F/CHR pathway controls a plethora of cell cycle genes, can contribute to cell cycle arrest and is a target for cancer therapy.</p></div>","key_words":{"index":["128"],"text":["virus"],"type":["organism"],"category":["taxonomy"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["7.0"],"d_l":["d"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5729532","DOI":"10.1038/cdd.2017.172","section":"publi"}

These mice exhibit shortened guts, as well as thinned thoracic muscle mass. Immunostaining showed these changes are partially caused by a decrease in the number of presumptive mesenchymal proliferating cells with loss of either FlnA or FlnA+Fmn2. This proliferation defect appears to be in part due to delayed differentiation in these regions. While both FlnA and FlnA+Fmn2 mice show reduced cell death relative to WT control, increased caspase staining was seen in the double null relative to FlnA null suggesting that this could also contribute to the FlnA+Fmn2 phenotype.

The system involves creating an array of 100 peptides that have been selected for broad capability to bind and/or kill viruses and bacteria. The peptides are pre-screened for low cell toxicity prior to large scale synthesis. Any pathogen is then assayed on the chip to find peptides that bind or kill it. Peptides are combined in pairs as synbodies and further screened for activity and toxicity. The lead synbody can be quickly produced in large scale, with completion of the entire process in one week.</p></div>","key_words":{"index":["127"],"text":["bacteria"],"type":["organism"],"category":["taxonomy"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["7.0"],"d_l":["d"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5730575","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-017-17941-7","section":"publi"}

Transient morpholino-knockdown is a solution to silence the expression of a gene of interest and promptly obtain insights on its contribution during the development of the zebrafish thyroid axis.

Currently, there are more than 100 AAV serotypes identified that differ in the binding capacity of capsid proteins to specific cell surface receptors that can transduce different cell types and brain regions in the CNS. In the current study, multiple AAV serotypes expressing a GFP reporter (AAV1, AAV2/1, AAVDJ, AAV8, AAVDJ8, AAV9, AAVDJ9) were screened for their infectivity in both primary murine astrocyte and neuronal cell cultures. AAV2/1, AAVDJ8 and AAV9 were selected for further investigation of their tropism throughout different brain regions and cell types. Each AAV was administered to P0-neonatal mice via intracerebroventricular injections (ICV). Brains were then systematically analyzed for GFP expression at 3 or 6 weeks post-infection in various regions, including the olfactory bulb, striatum, cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra (SN) and cerebellum. Cell counting data revealed that AAV2/1 infections were more prevalent in the cortical layers but penetrated to the midbrain less than AAVDJ8 and AAV9. Additionally, there were differences in the persistence of viral transgene expression amongst the three serotypes examined <em>in vivo</em> at 3 and 6 weeks post-infection. Because AAV-mediated transgene expression is of interest in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease, we examined the SN with microscopy techniques, such as CLARITY tissue transmutation, to identify AAV serotypes that resulted in optimal transgene expression in either astrocytes or dopaminergic neurons. AAVDJ8 displayed more tropism in astrocytes compared to AAV9 in the SN region. We conclude that ICV injection results in lasting expression of virally encoded transgene when using AAV vectors and that specific AAV serotypes are required to selectively deliver transgenes of interest to different brain regions in both astrocytes and neurons.</p></div>","key_words":{"index":["83","87","111","128","156","159","180"],"text":["brain","cns","astrocytes","virus","adeno-associated virus","aav","injection"],"type":["organ","organ","cell type","organism","system delivery","system delivery","system delivery"],"category":["disease","disease","sample type","taxonomy","viral","viral","non-viral"],"slide":["3.0","3.0","3.0","3.0","3.0","3.0","3.0"],"filter_query":["4.0","4.0","6.0","7.0","10.0","10.0","10.0"],"d_l":["d","d","l","d","l","l","l"],"s_m":["m","m","m","m","m","m","m"]},"PMCID":"5731760","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0188830","section":"publi"}

The classic view of granulocytes as terminally differentiated, short-lived phagocytes is therefore changing to phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous cells that are engaged in cross-talk with other leukocyte populations and provide an additional link between innate and adaptive immunity. In this brief review, we summarize the current knowledge on the antigen-presenting capacity of granulocyte subsets (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils). Underlying mechanisms, relevant physiological significance and potential controversies are also discussed.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">antigen presentation, MHC, neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["22","25"],"text":["immune","inflammatory"],"type":["therapeutic area","therapeutic area"],"category":["disease","disease"],"slide":["3.0","3.0"],"filter_query":["1.0","1.0"],"d_l":["l","l"],"s_m":["m","m"]},"PMCID":"5732227","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2017.01781","section":"publi"}

Current management of patients with leprosy is complex and requires multidrug therapy. Nonetheless, antibiotic treatment is insufficient to prevent nerve disabilities and control <em>Mycobacterium leprae</em>. Successful infectious disease treatment demands an understanding of the host immune response against a pathogen. Immune-based therapy is an effective treatment option for malignancies and infectious diseases. A promising therapeutic approach to improve the clinical outcome of malignancies is the blockade of immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoints refer to a wide range of inhibitory or regulatory pathways that are critical for maintaining self-tolerance and modulating the immune response. Programmed cell-death protein-1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, and lymphocyte-activation gene-3 are the most important immune checkpoint molecules. Several pathogens, including <em>M. leprae</em>, are supposed to utilize these mechanisms to evade the host immune response. Regulatory T cells and expression of co-inhibitory molecules on lymphocytes induce specific T-cell anergy/exhaustion, leading to disseminated and progressive disease. From this perspective, we outline how the co-inhibitory molecules PD-1, PD-L1, and Th1/Th17 versus Th2/Treg cells are balanced, how antigen-presenting cell maturation acts at different levels to inhibit T cells and modulate the development of leprosy, and how new interventions interfere with leprosy development.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">immunotherapy, leprosy, T-regulatory cells, immune checkpoint blockade, PD-1:PD-L1, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["22","94","106"],"text":["immune","t cells","t-cell"],"type":["therapeutic area","cell type","cell type"],"category":["disease","sample type","sample type"],"slide":["3.0","3.0","3.0"],"filter_query":["1.0","6.0","6.0"],"d_l":["l","l","l"],"s_m":["m","m","m"]},"PMCID":"5732247","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2017.01724","section":"publi"}

The only approved vaccine against TB, <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em> bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), provides insufficient protection and, being a live vaccine, can cause disseminated disease in immunocompromised individuals. Previously, we found that intradermal cDNA tattoo immunization with cDNA of tetanus toxoid fragment C domain 1 fused to cDNA of the fusion protein H56, comprising the <em>Mtb</em> antigens Ag85B, ESAT-6, and Rv2660c, induced antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses <em>in vivo</em>. As cDNA tattoo immunization would be safer than a live vaccine in immunocompromised patients, we tested the protective efficacy of intradermal tattoo immunization against TB with H56 cDNA, as well as with H56_E, a construct optimized for epitope processing in a mouse model. As <em>Mtb</em> antigens can be used in combination with BCG to boost immune responses, we also tested the protective efficacy of heterologous prime-boost, using dermal tattoo immunization with H56_E cDNA to boost BCG immunization in mice. Dermal H56 and H56_E cDNA immunization induced H56-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and Ag85B-specific IgG antibodies, but did not reduce bacterial loads, although immunization with H56_E ameliorated lung pathology. Both subcutaneous and intradermal immunization with BCG resulted in broad cellular immune responses, with increased frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> T effector memory cells, T follicular helper cells, and germinal center B cells, and resulted in reduced bacterial loads and lung pathology. Heterologous vaccination with BCG/H56_E cDNA induced increased H56-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytokine responses compared to vaccination with BCG alone, and lung pathology was significantly decreased in BCG/H56_E cDNA immunized mice compared to unvaccinated controls. However, bacterial loads were not decreased after heterologous vaccination compared to BCG alone.

Furthermore, the warming Arctic climate is suspected to influence abiotic and biotic long-range transport and exposure pathways of contaminants to the Arctic resulting in increases in POP exposure of both wildlife and human populations. Exposure to vector-borne diseases and zoonoses may increase as well through range expansion and introduction of invasive species. It will be important in the future to investigate the effects of these multiple stressors on wildlife and local people to better predict the individual-level health risks.

Although PARP inhibitors have been undergoing various clinical trials and the PARP1/2 inhibitor olaparib was approved as monotherapy for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, their mode of action in killing tumour cells is not fully understood. We investigated the effect of PARP inhibition on mitosis in cancerous (cervical, ovary, breast and osteosarcoma) and non-cancerous cells by live-cell imaging. The clinically relevant inhibitor olaparib induced strong perturbations in mitosis, including problems with chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate, anaphase delay, and premature loss of cohesion (cohesion fatigue) after a prolonged metaphase arrest, resulting in sister chromatid scattering. PARP1 and PARP2 depletion suppressed the phenotype while PARP2 overexpression enhanced it, suggesting that olaparib-bound PARP1 and PARP2 rather than the lack of catalytic activity causes this phenotype. Olaparib-induced mitotic chromatid scattering was observed in various cancer cell lines with increased protein levels of PARP1 and PARP2, but not in non-cancer or cancer cell lines that expressed lower levels of PARP1 or PARP2. Interestingly, the sister chromatid scattering phenotype occurred only when olaparib was added during the S-phase preceding mitosis, suggesting that PARP1 and PARP2 entrapment at replication forks impairs sister chromatid cohesion. Clinically relevant DNA-damaging agents that impair replication progression such as topoisomerase inhibitors and cisplatin were also found to induce sister chromatid scattering and metaphase plate alignment problems, suggesting that these mitotic phenotypes are a common outcome of replication perturbation.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">PARP inhibitors, mitosis, cohesion, PARP entrapment, live-cell imaging</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["176"],"text":["chromosome"],"type":["system delivery"],"category":["non-viral"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["10.0"],"d_l":["l"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5732777","DOI":"10.18632/oncotarget.21879","section":"publi"}

Unfortunately, cancer cells usually change their expression profile of miRNAs to form drug resistance against chemotherapy. In the present study, we focused on miR-216b to investigate whether miR-216b determined sensitivity of NSCLC cells to cisplatin. We observed that expression level of miR-216b was significantly decreased in NSCLC cell lines when they were under the cisplatin treatment.

As the downstream, overexpression of Bcl-xl induced by c-Jun/ATF2 heterodimers was inhibited in miR-216b transfected NSCLC cells.

HIV invades the brain early in the course of infection via penetration through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). While the impact of HIV on BBB astrocytes and endothelial cells is relatively well studied, the role of pericytes in BBB regulation during HIV infection remains unclear; however, it is known that a selective population of pericytes is prone to infection. In the present study, we hypothesize that injury signals are propagated from infected pericytes to neighboring cells via gap junction (GJ)-mediated intercellular communication. Among a variety of studied GJ proteins, HIV infection of human brain pericytes specifically increased expression of connexin 43 as determined by immunoblotting and immunostaining. This effect was confirmed in the brains of mice infected with EcoHIV, a mouse-specific HIV strain. In addition, HIV infection enhanced functional GJ-mediated intercellular communication in pericytes. The importance of this process was confirmed in experiments in which inhibition of GJs by carbenoxolone attenuated HIV infection. In addition to GJs, an extracellular ATP release assay revealed that HIV may also play a role in opening of connexin (Cx)-containing hemichannels (HCs). Overall, these findings indicate an important role of GJs in the propagation of HIV infection in human brain pericytes that may contribute to BBB dysfunction in brain infection and the pathogenesis of NeuroAIDS.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">pericytes, brain microvessels, HIV infection, gap junctions, connexin 43</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["83","111"],"text":["brain","astrocytes"],"type":["organ","cell type"],"category":["disease","sample type"],"slide":["3.0","3.0"],"filter_query":["4.0","6.0"],"d_l":["d","l"],"s_m":["m","m"]},"PMCID":"5732912","DOI":"10.3389/fnmol.2017.00410","section":"publi"}

Recent evidence indicates that pharmacological TAAR1 activation may offer a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of a wide range of neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorders. To assess potential neuroprotection by TAAR1 agonists, in the present work, we initially investigated whether T1AM and its corresponding 3-methylbiaryl-methane analog SG-2 can improve learning and memory when systemically administered to mice at submicromolar doses, and whether these effects are modified under conditions of MAO inhibition by clorgyline. Our results revealed that when i.p. injected to mice, both T1AM and SG-2 produced memory-enhancing and hyperalgesic effects, while increasing ERK1/2 phosphorylation and expression of transcription factor <em>c</em>-fos. Notably, both compounds appeared to rely on the action of ubiquitous enzymes MAO to produce the corresponding oxidative metabolites that were then able to activate the histaminergic system. Since autophagy is key for neuronal plasticity, in a second line of experiments we explored whether T1AM and synthetic TAAR1 agonists SG1 and SG2 were able to induce autophagy in human glioblastoma cell lines (U-87MG). After treatment of U-87MG cells with 1 μM T1AM, SG-1, SG-2 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunofluorescence (IF) showed a significant time-dependent increase of autophagy vacuoles and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Consistently, Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase of the LC3II/LC3I ratio, with T1AM and SG-1 being the most effective agents. A decreased level of the p62 protein was also observed after treatment with T1AM and SG-1, which confirms the efficacy of these compounds as autophagy inducers in U-87MG cells. In the process to dissect which pathway induces ATG, the effects of these compounds were evaluated on the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. We found that 1 μM T1AM, SG-1 and SG-2 decreased pAKT/AKT ratio at 0.5 and 4 h after treatment, suggesting that autophagy is induced by inhibiting mTOR phosphorylation by PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.

Untreated infections can rapidly evolve toward the condition of sepsis in which the body begins to fail and resuscitation becomes critical and tenuous. Identification of infection followed by rapid antimicrobial treatment are primary goals of medical care, but precise identification of offending organisms by current methods is slow and broad spectrum empirical therapy is employed to cover most potential pathogens. Current methods for identification of bacterial pathogens in a clinical setting typically require days of time, or a 4- to 8-h growth phase followed by DNA extraction, purification and PCR-based amplification. We demonstrate rapid (70–120 min) genetic diagnostics methods utilizing loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to test for 15 common infection pathogen targets, called the Infection Diagnosis Panel (In-Dx). The method utilizes filtration to rapidly concentrate bacteria in sample matrices with lower bacterial loads and direct LAMP amplification without DNA purification from clinical blood, urine, wound, sputum and stool samples. The In-Dx panel was tested using two methods of detection: (1) real-time thermocycler fluorescent detection of LAMP amplification and (2) visual discrimination of color change in the presence of Eriochrome Black T (EBT) dye following amplification. In total, 239 duplicate samples were collected (31 blood, 122 urine, 73 mucocutaneous wound/swab, 11 sputum and two stool) from 229 prospectively enrolled hospital patients with suspected clinical infection and analyzed both at the hospital and by In-Dx.

As an inhibitor of NF-κB signaling, Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) was reported to relieve cancer cachexia; however, its mechanism remains largely unknown. In our study, we showed that PDTC attenuated cancer cachexia symptom in C26 tumor bearing mice models <em>in vivo</em> without influencing tumor volume. What’s more, PDTC inhibited muscle atrophy and lipolysis in cells models <em>in vitro</em> induced by TNFα and C26 tumor medium. PDTC suppressed atrophy of myotubes differentiated from C2C12 by reducing MyoD and upregulating MuRF1, and preserving the expression of perilipin as well as blocking the activation of HSL in 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes. Meaningfully, we observed that PDTC also inhibited p38 MAPK signaling besides the NF-κB signaling in cancer cachexia <em>in vitro</em> models. In addition, PDTC also influenced the protein synthesis of skeletal muscle by activating AKT signaling and regulated fat energy metabolism by inhibiting AMPK signaling. Therefore, PDTC primarily influenced different pathways in different tissues.

The minimal number of such events between two genomes is often used in phylogenomic studies to measure the evolutionary distance between the genomes. Double-Cut-and-Join (DCJ) operations represent a convenient model of most common genome rearrangements (reversals, translocations, fissions, and fusions), while other genome rearrangements, such as transpositions, can be modeled by pairs of DCJs. Since the DCJ model does not directly account for transpositions, their impact on DCJ scenarios is unclear. In the present work, we study implicit appearance of transpositions (as pairs of DCJs) in DCJ scenarios. We consider shortest DCJ scenarios satisfying the maximum parsimony assumption, as well as more general DCJ scenarios based on some realistic but less restrictive assumptions. In both cases, we derive a uniform lower bound for the rate of implicit transpositions, which depends only on the genomes but not a particular DCJ scenario between them. Our results imply that implicit appearance of transpositions in DCJ scenarios may be unavoidable or even abundant for some pairs of genomes. We estimate that for mammalian genomes implicit transpositions constitute at least 6% of genome rearrangements.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">genome rearrangements, transpositions, DCJ, breakpoint graphs, chromosome evolution</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["176"],"text":["chromosome"],"type":["system delivery"],"category":["non-viral"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["10.0"],"d_l":["l"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5733028","DOI":"10.3389/fgene.2017.00212","section":"publi"}

Here, we show crystal structures of <em>V. alginolyticus</em> FadR (ValFadR) alone and its complex with the palmitoyl-CoA, a long-chain fatty acyl ligand different from the oleoyl-CoA occupied by VcFadR. Structural comparison indicates that both VcFadR and ValFadR consistently have an additional ligand-binding site (called site 2), which leads to more dramatic conformational-change of DNA-binding domain than that of the <em>E. coli</em> FadR (EcFadR). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analyses defines that the ligand-binding pattern of ValFadR (2:1) is distinct from that of EcFadR (1:1). Together with surface plasmon resonance (SPR), electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrates that ValFadR binds <em>fabA</em>, an important gene of unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) synthesis. The removal of <em>fadR</em> from <em>V. cholerae</em> attenuates <em>fabA</em> transcription and results in the unbalance of UFA/SFA incorporated into membrane phospholipids. Genetic complementation of the mutant version of <em>fadR</em> (Δ42, 136-177) lacking site 2 cannot restore the defective phenotypes of Δ<em>fadR</em> while the wild-type <em>fadR</em> gene and addition of exogenous oleate can restore them. Mice experiments reveals that VcFadR and its site 2 have roles in bacterial colonizing.

In this paper, we used 482 cultivars, representing the breeding history of bread wheat in Australia since 1840, to characterize their diversity and population structure and to define the geographical ancestral background of Australian wheat germplasm. This was achieved by comparing them to a global wheat collection using <em>in-silico</em> chromosome painting based on SNP genotyping. The global collection involved 2,335 wheat accessions which was divided into 23 different geographical subpopulations. However, the whole set was reduced to 1,544 accessions to increase the differentiation and decrease the admixture among different global subpopulations to increase the power of the painting analysis. Our analysis revealed that the structure of Australian wheat germplasm and its geographic ancestors have changed significantly through time, especially after the Green Revolution. Before 1920, breeders used cultivars from around the world, but mainly Europe and Africa, to select potential cultivars that could tolerate Australian growing conditions. Between 1921 and 1970, a dependence on African wheat germplasm became more prevalent. Since 1970, a heavy reliance on International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) germplasm has persisted. Combining the results from linkage disequilibrium, population structure and <em>in-silico</em> painting revealed that the dependence on CIMMYT materials has varied among different Australian States, has shrunken the germplasm effective population size and produced larger linkage disequilibrium blocks. This study documents the evolutionary history of wheat breeding in Australia and provides an understanding for how the wheat genome has been adapted to local growing conditions. This information provides a guide for industry to assist with maintaining genetic diversity for long-term selection gains and to plan future breeding programs.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">australian wheat, geographical ancestor, genetic diversity, <em>in-silico</em> chromosome painting, population structure, single nucleotide polymorphism</span></div>","key_words":{"index":["176"],"text":["chromosome"],"type":["system delivery"],"category":["non-viral"],"slide":["3.0"],"filter_query":["10.0"],"d_l":["l"],"s_m":["m"]},"PMCID":"5733070","DOI":"10.3389/fpls.2017.02115","section":"publi"}

Of 150 birds screened, 26 (17.3%) were fecal carriers of ESBL-<em>E. coli</em>. Of these, 88.4% isolates exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotypes. Resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ampicillin, doxycycline, tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (CTX-CAZ-AM-DC-TE-SXT) represented the most common pattern of MDR (76.9%).
